# Combine Framework - Presentation Slides Summary

## Slide 1: Introduction to Combine
- Apple's reactive programming framework
- Declarative API for processing values over time
- Released in iOS 13 / macOS 10.15

## Slide 2: Why Combine?
- Handles async events elegantly
- Replaces completion handlers & delegates
- Built-in error handling
- Type-safe data flows
- Integrates with SwiftUI

## Slide 3: Core Components
### Publishers
- Emit values over time
- Examples: Just, Future, Publishers.Sequence

### Subscribers  
- Consume values from publishers
- Examples: sink, assign

### Subjects
- Combine characteristics of publishers & subscribers
- CurrentValueSubject, PassthroughSubject

## Slide 4: Operators Overview
- Transform operators: map, tryMap, flatMap
- Filter operators: filter, removeDuplicates
- Time-based: debounce, throttle, delay
- Error handling: catch, retry, replaceError

## Slide 5: Publisher Example
```swift
let cancellable = Just("Hello")
    .sink { value in
        print(value)
    }
```

## Slide 6: Network Request Example
```swift
URLSession.shared
    .dataTaskPublisher(for: url)
    .map(\.data)
    .decode(type: Model.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in /* handle completion */ },
        receiveValue: { model in /* handle model */ }
    )
```

## Slide 7: Memory Management
- Store cancellables to prevent premature disposal
- Use Set<AnyCancellable> for multiple subscriptions
- Call .store(in:) to manage lifetime

## Slide 8: Best Practices
- Start with simple examples
- Understand the data flow
- Handle errors appropriately
- Use proper schedulers for UI updates
- Avoid retain cycles

## Slide 9: Integration with SwiftUI
- @Published properties
- .onReceive modifier
- ObservableObject protocol
- Publishers in ViewModifiers

## Slide 10: Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Forgetting to store cancellables
- Incorrect scheduler usage
- Overcomplicating simple operations
- Creating retain cycles

## Slide 11: Learning Resources
- Apple's Combine documentation
- WWDC sessions on Combine
- Sample projects
- Practice by refactoring existing code
